- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @onestepby: A student at SAIT in Information Technology majoring in Network Systems.
- After enrolling, I have been exposed to the world of IT, and am trying to improve myself with the studying materials given at school
- by doing personal projects on my off time in between school and part-time job!


- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning code and Information technology infrastructure to further my experience with projects.
----- Currently I am aiming to gain certifications in, CompTIA A+, Security+, Azure, AWS, and Linux+
----- Since I am in school, planning on taking full advantages of the perks in Linkedin learning, Free tier AWS learning, VMware Vsphere, station, and Linux Redhat and CentOS!

This is just the beginning of the journey of my self-development ~


Will EDIT my progression here as the year goes by.
